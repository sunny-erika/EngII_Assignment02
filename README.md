Summary Write-Up:

Code that binds the effect and draws the mesh:

Started with a triangle:

Changed to a rectangle:

And then I created my own shape (mushroom) as shown on the top of the page.

Another task was to use a Direct3D GPU capture in the VS Graphics Analyzer:
- Render target when it is all black (the ClearRenderTargetView() function is highlighted)

- render target with the mesh (the Draw() function is highlighted) 

- Pipeline Stages tab is selected, and the mesh is visible as "wireframe", where the two triangles are visible

In addition the OpenGL GPU capture had to be created in RenderDoc:
- Render target when it is all black (the glClear() function is highlighted, and the Texture View tab is selected)

- Render target with the mesh (the glDrawArrays() function is highlighted and the Texture View tab is selected)

- Mesh's two triangles (the glDrawArrays() function is highlighted but the Mesh Output tab is selected, and either the VS Input or VS Output sub-tab is selected)
